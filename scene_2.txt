What are the advantages of automating software builds? How will you automate build and deployment of a Java web application?
●What types of testing would you include as part of the automation?
●How do you approach testing of a web front end?

A)	Build automation is the process of automating the creation of a software build and the associated processes including: 
  compiling computer source code into binary code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests.

  Advantages:
  The advantages of build automation to software development projects include
  A necessary pre-condition for continuous integration and continuous testing
  Improve product quality
  Accelerate the compile and link processing
  Eliminate redundant tasks
  Minimize "bad builds"
  Eliminate dependencies on key personnel
  Have history of builds and releases in order to investigate issues
  Save time and money - because of the reasons listed above.
  
  How to buld and deploy:
  Create a base test class from which all other tests derive. 
  It has to be abstract so the automatic unit test collector doesn't try to run it.

  Testing types:
  Layering test types.
  Input – output test.
  UI regression test.
  Unit test.
  Integration test.
  Code analysis.
  Production logging and monitoring.
  
  Testing of a web front end:
  Frontend Testing is a type of testing that checks the Presentation layer of a 3 Tier Architecture.
  UI testing.
  Functional testing.
  Cross-Browser testing.
  Presentation Testing.
  CSS testing.
